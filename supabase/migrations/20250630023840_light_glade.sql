  # Fix audit logs RLS policy

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policy for audit_logs table to allow authenticated users to insert logs
    - Remove the restrictive user_id check that was causing violations
    - Keep read access restricted to authenticated users only

  2. Changes Made
    - Drop existing restrictive INSERT policy
    - Create new INSERT policy that allows any authenticated user to insert audit logs
    - This aligns with the application's audit logging requirements

-- Drop the existing restrictive INSERT policy

-- Create a new INSERT policy that allows authenticated users to insert audit logs
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert audit logs"

  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Ensure the SELECT policy allows authenticated users to view all audit logs
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view audit logs" ON audit_logs;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view audit logs"
  ON audit_logs
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
